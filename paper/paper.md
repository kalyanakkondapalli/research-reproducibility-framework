# Summary
The Research Reproducibility Framework (RRF) is a Python toolkit for packaging datasets, code, 
dependencies, and results into reproducible bundles. It provides CLI, Docker, and optional dashboard 
support for executing and validating workflows.

# Statement of need
Many scientific studies fail reproducibility due to missing data, environment inconsistencies, or undocumented workflows.
RRF addresses these challenges by providing a standardized way to package and replay research projects.

- **Language:** Python 3.9+  
- **License:** MIT  
- **Dependencies:** typer, pyyaml, fastapi, uvicorn, pytest
